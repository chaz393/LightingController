# LightingController

I wanted a way to control the lights in my room, but with the control to add or do whatever I wanted with them. Instead of being limited by whatever third party service I chose, I decided to write my own controller. I also just prefer to self host eveything I can. I use IFTTT to trigger events because the smart plugs I bought have a closed API, but integrate with IFTTT. All the logic is handled in this project so I can make whatever changes I want whenever I want, but the triggering scene switching is handled with IFTTT. In reality this is just a hugely over complicated way to turn off some lights after sunset.
