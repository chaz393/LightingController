# LightingController

I wanted a way to control the lights in my room, but with the control to add or do whatever I wanted with them. Instead of being limited by a third party service, I decided to write my own controller. I also prefer to self host eveything I can so that I'm not relying on 3rd party services continuing to function indefinitely. Also, doing everything locally removes the couple second delay when turning things on and off. I flashed all the smart switches/plugs with Tasmota firmware so that I can send commands to them. I considered writing my own basic firmware since all I really need is toggle on/off, but it was eaier to just use Tasmota even if it is massive overkill for what I'm using it for. In reality this whole thing is just a hugely over complicated way to turn off some lights.
